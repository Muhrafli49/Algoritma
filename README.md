# Coding Challenges

This repository contains solutions to four algorithmic problems implemented in JavaScript. Each problem is handled in a separate directory for clarity. The provided solutions showcase different programming concepts and problem-solving skills.

## Problems

### 1. Reverse Alphabet with Numbers
**Description:** Given the string "NEGIE1", reverse the alphabetical characters while keeping the digits at the end in their original position.  
**Example:**  
Input: `"NEGIE1"`  
Output: `"EIGEN1"`

### 2. Longest Word in Sentence
**Description:** Given a sentence, find the longest word. If there are multiple words with the same length, return one of them.  
**Example:**  
Input: `"Saya sangat senang mengerjakan soal algoritma"`  
Output: `"mengerjakan"` (11 characters)

### 3. Count Occurrences in Input Array
**Description:** Given two arrays, `INPUT` and `QUERY`, determine how many times each word in `QUERY` appears in `INPUT`.  
**Example:**  
Input:  
```json
{
  "INPUT": ["xc", "dz", "bbb", "dz"],
  "QUERY": ["bbb", "ac", "dz"]
}

### 4. Calculate the Diagonal Difference in a Matrix
**Description:**  
Find the absolute difference between the sums of the primary and secondary diagonals of an NxN matrix.

**Example:**

For the matrix:
```json
[
    [1, 2, 0],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
